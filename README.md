# ConsoleGui
A simple graphical user interface for console applications or command line interfaces.

Create reusable templates of combinations of parameters passed to the console application.

A tray menu provides quick access to your console templates in the gui.

Decide which parameters to hide and show when other parameters change.

Also decide which parameter to focus and start with as parameters change.

The console parameter rules are maintained in a easy to understand xml file.
